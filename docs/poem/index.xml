In other words: please be true In other words: I love you&amp;rdquo; —In Other Words, Bart Howard (1954)

      <description>when you were here before, things were different.
but now that you&amp;rsquo;re gone I learnt myself. although I lost you,
my soul and the importance of you placed oppositely on those old-fashioned scales:
gravity doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide for me. so self-centred is it, she, he, they (whoever the fuck YOU are)
that my soul&amp;rsquo;s weight fluctuates to my heart&amp;rsquo;s desire.</description>

      <description>A dark light now unnights my soul. A bare interior within Where grey walls now entrap me in Blinding depression. Yet I see No windows, no doors; I had screamed, Stuck in stagnation; sinister Past.
 Why can’t it be more peaceful?  And future feels funeral for Ever. You both could make my presents Playful. My gaiety should Not be culpable, but from the Gallery.
 ‘Encore!’ it’s justice  Ruled my prosecution, upon Whom I have so much relied so Inexorably, tightening Nooses.</description>

      <description>Fresh poison for sale, buy now Before someone you know can. No, we don’t do executions here; We’re a friendly business. Try your Other friends.
They’re nice.</description>

      <description>TVs flickering in the street, and Strobing the docile faces, and Pulsing the pleasures of another people.
Biharmonic stereo, play. This mono thinking delay Pushes us into dismay; Ultimately the stereo stray.
Boring books burning bright: Soot makes you stutter. Darkness now hidden behind The anthracite cloak. Please don&amp;rsquo;t let the salamander get me&amp;hellip;
Listen, and listen well. Seeming specious, how alien it seems! Chanting chords: now a diminished art. Say what you came to say, and go!</description>

      <description>The taxi driver desolately peers With beautiful blues blaring in his cab. His cheeks becoming stained and daubed with tears. Awaiting blithely that next drunken drab.
His sharpened scalpel, recently stolen, Now covets blood once more on Christmas eve. &amp;lsquo;Crime pays the dime on time,&amp;rsquo; he chants his omen. Snowy teardrops always join begs of leave.
This sweet piano dampens heavy souls Because the midnight sun will never set. &amp;lsquo;Baby, baby, don&amp;rsquo;t you know these rolling roads Make the midnight monster in me?</description>

      <description>~I~ &amp;lsquo;Who am I?&amp;rsquo; you asked casually. They swept away the philosophy, Called it a flagrant waste of time. You paused and realised the irony. ~II~ Misunderstanding is ubiquitous but Understood. Tell me, tell me. Tell me what I am, Who I am and How I am. Because You do it anyway.
Tell me where I am: Perplexed miens of perceived ineptness Or inherited doubt. rid, rid, riddance.
Life&amp;rsquo;s a game, but not for us.</description>

      <description>Not stupidity. Not intelligence. Not individuality. Not humanity.
Watch Death larking, &#39;Cause he always loved it— And you can see it in his eyes. I run to him; I can&#39;t see; I feel; I-I! What&amp;rsquo;s the last sentiment? Why so hesitant? It&amp;rsquo;s only me. Crazed, yet resident desperation.</description>

      <description>Hang the man, Guess the letter. Fuck the man with Your incessant stupidity.
Game of young; Gamble of life. Why do you summon Me to your tall Towers of bloodied Execution? Vowel, two consonants, and another beam. The noose tightens As the pens strokes.
DEATH IS FREEDOM</description>

      <description>The third rule is broke And our cathedral bursts. Fracture the walls But not our spirit.</description>
