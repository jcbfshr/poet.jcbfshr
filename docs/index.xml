A bare interior within
Where grey walls now entrap me in
Blinding depression. Yet I see
No windows; no doors; I had screamed,
Stuck in stagnation; sinister
Past.

      Why can’t it be more peaceful?
And future feels funeral for
Ever. You both could make my presents
Playful. My gaiety should
Not be culpable, but from the
Gallery.

         ‘Encore!’ it’s justice
Ruled my prosecution, upon
Whom I have so much relied so
Inexorably, tightening
Nooses.

        Mine in a dim bathroom
Has become surrounded by an
Everest of balsam. I am
Desolate.

          In the water-room,
I feel escaped from my dead bed.
Twist.

       Violently; thrust different
Yesterday. Now my home is.

                           Wretched.]]></description>

Before someone you know can.
No, we don’t do executions here;
We’re a friendly business. Try your
Other friends.

They’re nice.

            <guid>https://poet.jcbfshr.com/flicker/</guid><description><![CDATA[TVs flickering in the street, and
Strobing the docile faces, and
Pulsing the pleasures of another people.

Biharmonic stereo, play.
This mono thinking delay
Pushes us into dismay;
Ultimately the stereo stray.

Boring books burning bright:
Soot makes you stutter.
Darkness now hidden behind
The anthracite cloak.
Please don't let the salamander get me...

Listen, and listen well.
Seeming specious, how alien it seems!
Chanting chords: now a diminished art.
Say what you came to say, and go!
We're tired of the nude liberties;
We want the world to be blue.
~~~
D'you remember that? Blue.
Red blue red. Viscous and venous.

            <title>Cabs at Christmas</title>

            <guid>https://poet.jcbfshr.com/cabs-at-christmas/</guid><description><![CDATA[The taxi driver desolately peers
With beautiful blues blaring in his cab.
His cheeks becoming stained and daubed with tears.
Awaiting blithely that next drunken drab.

His sharpened scalpel, recently stolen,
Now covets blood once more on Christmas eve.
'Crime pays the dime on time,' he chants his omen.
Snowy teardrops always join begs of leave.

This sweet piano dampens heavy souls
Because the midnight sun will never set.
'Baby, baby, don't you know these rolling roads
Make the midnight monster in me?' Forget...

Mind of murder, scalpel of salvation;
Now I bid, rid of this cold creation.

They swept away the philosophy,
Called it a flagrant waste of time.
You paused and realised the irony.

Misunderstanding is ubiquitous but
Understood. Tell me, tell me.
Tell me what I am,
Who I am and
How I am. Because
You do it anyway.

Tell me where I am:
Perplexed miens of perceived ineptness
Or inherited doubt.
rid, rid, riddance.

Life's a game, but not for us.
Retrospectively, you were
Never really happy.
So tell me, executioner:
Why am I,
Still here?

We've stopped thinking—so
You're no longer being.
'All around!' they clamour,
'We've come to see your last stammer.']]></description>

Not individuality. Not humanity.
~~~
Watch Death larking,
'Cause he always loved it—
And you can see it in his eyes.

I run to him;
I can't see;
I feel;
I-I!
~~~
What's the last sentiment?
Why so hesitant?
It's only me.
Crazed, yet resident desperation.

Guess the letter.
Fuck the man with
Your incessant stupidity.
~~~
Game of young;
Gamble of life.
Why do you summon
Me to your tall
Towers of bloodied
Execution?
~~~
Vowel, two consonants,
and another beam.
The noose tightens
As the pens strokes.

DEATH
IS
FREEDOM]]></description>
