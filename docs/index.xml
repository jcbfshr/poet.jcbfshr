Track (i) whereupon (vii) of "This=Everything" by National Skyline.
~/Centre~

You are the Rth Italian river, traversed
With a Caesarian invitation
From my own (flipping) portable.
Derision devolving to the unlighted:
Hoping our innondation won't 'first-impression'
Towards fantastical reparations whcih aren't affordable.

Pitied and sympathied—evoking niceness
Of course hopefully misconstrued but jealousy
Distances them as a googol lightyears.
The crowd contorts contra the anti-Christ. ~~Us~~
Me. Although the bath-room sheltered me,
The mirror's sharp, blunt!

You on the cylinder and I hedge-hog.

If you care, as your eyes show your soul,
You wouldn’t need to tango lexically.
Don’t let your eyes dodge me and your words touch me.
Don’t hug me to humour me.
Don’t palter with me to protract possibilites.
When angry, speak!
I don’t want to hate you.

I’m just doing the things as before
That deliver me to hurt again;
I wish life would stop driving me to poetry.

Train from Canterbury. 27 September 2021.
Wolf Alice’s Don’t Delete the Kisses.
~/Centre~

Departing first my train. Then my tears.
And I was writing a palimpsest of mistakes.
The palimpsest was my opacifying barrier.
Everybody tells me I was right.
Quiet, pathetic sobber.
Against the steady kick and a
Blur of nature.
By degrees 
In
Nothing I felt eveything.
But you were
Endangering—and I you.
Never can I hate you;
I proclaim so to circles.
Tonight, sighs rattle the skull
Such chill—so unexplained.
I hardly blame you for
Talking to me. But, O, the addiction!
Dealer unwittingly hooking with free sample of
Amour... -propre; he doesn’t supply anymore.
END

Forty weeks, then forty-two. Then the days
played peekaboo. By Wednesday noon,
hours kicked, and at forty-three, minutes
scratched. We got a pamphlet; doctor
withdrew us four as if to reassure.

Induced, the labour is said to be.
Post-term, the baby is said to be.
Late, the mother is said to be.

Westminster Bridge and its amber
lights hazing my tears. For quick
respite, wind freezes them in place.
As though I need to exhibit such freedoms.

The consultant said we could be in the room.
Why wasn't he?
@II@
About our baby, paralysed, I would kill
to stop the whine. I could kill,
dare I to move, seven thousand hours
of life accrued. Screams pierce ordinarily.
This one's intentless, an incessant,
titanic broadcast of suffering?
Inaccessible, the scream-inducers lure me
to paralysis against the pleaing shriek.
Cease the pain and overturn the
futile cries. There wasn't a champagne
tap but a fast bleep.

@III@
If only I knew how to save a life,
castaway on this north wing, seventh floor.
Receptionists and signs donate a buzz of fame
opposite. Gynae: where a whole new world of
'lap and dye,' or 'D and C' awaits diploid
destiny.
Obs and gynae, obs and gynae, obs
and gynae.
Obs and gynae, sobs and gynae, sobs
and gynae.

A bare interior within
Where grey walls now entrap me in
Blinding depression. Yet I see
No windows, no doors; I had screamed,
Stuck in stagnation; sinister
Past.

            Why can’t it be more peaceful?
And future feels funeral for
Ever. You both could make my presents
Playful. My gaiety should
Not be culpable, but from the
Gallery.

                ‘Encore!’ it’s justice
Ruled my prosecution, upon
Whom I have so much relied so
Inexorably, tightening
Nooses.

                Mine in a dim bathroom
Has become surrounded by an
Everest of balsam. I am
Desolate.

                  In the water-room,
I feel escaped from my dead bed.
Twist.

               Violently; thrust different
Yesterday. Now my home is.

Strobing the docile faces, and
Pulsing the pleasures of another people.

Biharmonic stereo, play.
This mono thinking delay
Pushes us into dismay;
Ultimately the stereo stray.

Boring books burning bright:
Soot makes you stutter.
Darkness now hidden behind
The anthracite cloak.
Please don't let the salamander get me...

Listen, and listen well.
Seeming specious, how alien it seems!
Chanting chords: now a diminished art.
Say what you came to say, and go!
We're tired of the nude liberties;
We want the world to be blue.
~~~
D'you remember that? Blue.
Red blue red. Viscous and venous.

With beautiful blues blaring in his cab.
His cheeks becoming stained and daubed with tears.
Awaiting blithely that next drunken drab.

His sharpened scalpel, recently stolen,
Now covets blood once more on Christmas eve.
'Crime pays the dime on time,' he chants his omen.
Snowy teardrops always join begs of leave.

This sweet piano dampens heavy souls
Because the midnight sun will never set.
'Baby, baby, don't you know these rolling roads
Make the midnight monster in me?' Forget...

Mind of murder, scalpel of salvation;
Now I bid, rid of this cold creation.

'Who am I?' you asked casually.
They swept away the philosophy,
Called it a flagrant waste of time.
You paused and realised the irony.
@II@
Misunderstanding is ubiquitous but
Understood. Tell me, tell me.
Tell me what I am,
Who I am and
How I am. Because
You do it anyway.

Tell me where I am:
Perplexed miens of perceived ineptness
Or inherited doubt.
rid, rid, riddance.

Life's a game, but not for us.
Retrospectively, you were
Never really happy.
So tell me, executioner:
Why am I,
Still here?

We've stopped thinking—so
You're no longer being.
'All around!' they clamour,
'We've come to see your last stammer.'

Not individuality. Not humanity.

Watch Death larking,
'Cause he always loved it—
And you can see it in his eyes.

I run to him;
I can't see;
I feel;
I-I!
~~~
What's the last sentiment?
Why so hesitant?
It's only me.
Crazed, yet resident desperation.

Guess the letter.
Fuck the man with
Your incessant stupidity.

Game of young;
Gamble of life.
Why do you summon
Me to your tall
Towers of bloodied
Execution?

Vowel, two consonants,

The noose tightens
As the pens strokes.

DEATH
IS
FREEDOM.
